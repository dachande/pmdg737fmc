# Axis And Ohs (AAO) PMDG 737 FMC add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

by pilznille / Version 1.20 / 3 October 2022

This tool is an add-on for Axis And Ohs (AAO) that allows you to access the CDU of the PMDG 737 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 via a web browser. It shows a complete CDU (screen + keypad) and can be operated 100% via the web browser.

This release is based on the initial version of the CDU add-on created by Lorby and friends.

**The web CDU requires an up-to-date browser to work !**

**This is a work in progress. There might still be bugs around so please note that it might not work as expected.**

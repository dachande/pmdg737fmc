# TODO

The following features are still to be implemented.

* Switch between CDUs without the need to reload the browser window to get back to preselect screen
* Add querystring parameter to allow preselection of left/right CDU skipping the preselect screen
* Add screen-only CDU without keypad (useful for home cockpit)
* Add button input queue for faster input

## Known Bugs:

* CLR key release event sometimes doesn't trigger if key is pressed too fast resuling in clearing out the scratchpad
